// Verifies that a multi-line exemption comment is read as a reasoned exemption,

//
// exemptionOf is line-oriented; when the closing --> falls on a later line it
// saw no reason on the marker line and returned blank, so coverage told the
// author "an exemption with no reason" about a reason they plainly wrote. The
// text after the marker on the first line is the reason; only a marker with
// nothing after it is blank.
//
//  1. Read a reason whose closing marker wrapped onto the next line.
//  2. Distinguish it from a genuinely blank marker.
//  3. Confirm the single-line form still parses unchanged.
