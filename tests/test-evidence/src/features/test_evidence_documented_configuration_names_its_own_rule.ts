/**
 * Verifies a misconfigured `evidence/documented` names itself through the real
 * binary.
 *
 * The Go cases pin the message text; this pins what a consumer actually reads,
 * which is the only place the misattribution ever mattered. A project with both
 * rules enabled was told its _graph_ configuration was invalid while the
 * graph's configuration was fine, so the reader's next move was to edit the one
 * setting that was not wrong.
 *
 * The project deliberately spans several files. The diagnostic repeats once per
 * file — a file rule decodes its options inside `Check` and has no earlier
 * place to speak from — and the assertions below stay silent about how many
 * times it appears, so that this case does not cement a multiplicity that #57
 * records as unresolved.
 *
 * 1. Enable both rules, misspelling one `evidence/documented` option key.
 * 2. Run `ttsc check`.
 * 3. Assert the failure names `evidence/documented` and never the graph.
