// Package evidence is the Go rule set of `@samchon/evidence`, a `@ttsc/lint`
// contributor that turns provenance into a compile error.
//
// It ships as SOURCE, not as a module: ttsc copies this directory into
// @ttsc/lint's own Go module as a sub-package and supplies every dependency
// from the host module's graph. Two consequences follow, and both are easy to
// forget.
//
// Only the standard library and packages already in @ttsc/lint's module graph
// are importable. This package's go.mod exists for local tooling and has no say
// in the ttsc build, so a dependency that resolves under `go test ./native`
// can still be absent when ttsc links these rules. That is why the glob matcher
// here is hand-rolled rather than delegated to doublestar.
//
// The blank import ttsc synthesizes fires init() below before main, which is
// the only registration that matters. The `rules` array in ../src/index.ts is
// advisory and powers autocomplete alone.
