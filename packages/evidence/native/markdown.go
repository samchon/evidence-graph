//
// It is an HTML comment so it stays invisible in every renderer while remaining
// plain text in the source — the exemption is a decision for reviewers of the
// document, not a note for its readers.
//
// A lint disable comment on the citing side would be the cheaper mechanism and
// is the wrong one: it lives in TypeScript while the uncited thing is a section,
// it is invisible to the graph so nobody can ask how many exemptions a
// repository carries, it suppresses every future diagnostic on that node rather
