/**
 * A population of Markdown claims that must acknowledge the owning source.
 *
 * Markdown uses HTML comments as invisible but reviewable declaration hosts.
 * Both `@evidence <target> <reason>` and `@evidenceExclude <target> <reason>`
 * require a target and a non-empty explanation.
 *
 * An exclusion still has to appear in a selected reference file and on a
 * selected host kind. Its particular host is not part of the acknowledgement
 * identity, so moving it between eligible sections cannot change which source
 * unit the reference group excludes.
 *
 * @example
 *   <!-- @evidence docs/orders.md#create-order This section adopts the creation contract. -->

  /**
   * Project-relative glob patterns for Markdown files that must cite the owning
   * evidence source. Every matching regular file is parsed as Markdown
   * regardless of extension, so exclude non-Markdown assets.
   *
   * These are globs, not regular expressions. `*` matches within one path
   * segment, `**` crosses any number of path segments, and `?` matches one
   * character. Both `/` and `\` are accepted as separators, while path identity
   * remains case-sensitive on every operating system.
   *
   * Patterns are evaluated from left to right. A pattern prefixed with `!`
   * removes its matches; a later positive pattern can include them again. The
   * array must contain at least one positive pattern.
   *
   * For example, `docs/*.md` selects Markdown files directly under `docs`,
   * while `specs/v?.md` selects names such as `v1.md` but not `v10.md`.
   *
   * A bare directory such as `docs` or `docs/` does not include its children;
   * write `docs/**` when the whole subtree belongs to this reference group.
