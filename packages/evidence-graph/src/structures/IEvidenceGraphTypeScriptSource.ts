   * Project-relative glob patterns for candidate TypeScript files in the active

   * not available to the rule and does not count as a match.
   *
   * These are globs, not regular expressions. `*` matches within one path
   * segment, `**` crosses any number of path segments, and `?` matches one
   * character. Both `/` and `\` are accepted as separators, while path identity
   * remains case-sensitive on every operating system.
   *
   * Patterns are evaluated from left to right. A pattern prefixed with `!`
   * removes its matches; a later positive pattern can include them again. The
   * array must contain at least one positive pattern.
   *
   * For example, `src/**` selects the complete source subtree, while
   * `scripts/check-?.ts` selects `check-a.ts` but not `check-ab.ts`.
   *
   * A bare directory such as `src` or `src/` does not include its children;
   * write `src/**` when the whole subtree belongs to this source group.
