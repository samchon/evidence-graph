 * Verifies that coverage rejects a missing or empty document scope instead of
 * guessing the whole markdown corpus.
 *
 * Project rules cannot read one another's options, so coverage cannot inherit
 * the index scope. Falling back to every markdown file can demand citations for
 * unrelated guides while making coverage and reference disagree about which
 * documents exist.
 *
 * 1. Enable coverage once without options and once with an empty document list.
 * 2. Run each configuration against an explicitly scoped evidence index.
 * 3. Assert both fail with a diagnostic that names the required repair.
