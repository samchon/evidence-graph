/**
 * Verifies Swagger file references through the published consumer boundary.
 *
 * The rule is Go while Swagger normalization is JavaScript, so unit-testing
 * either half cannot prove the linked binary finds the package helper and its
 * runtime dependencies. A Swagger 2.0 YAML document also exercises both the
 * dialect upgrade and non-JSON parser before coverage is evaluated.
 *
 * 1. Configure a typed Swagger reference to one project-relative YAML file.
 * 2. Cite its POST operation from an exported TypeScript type.
 * 3. Assert the real `ttsc check` accepts the complete operation graph.
